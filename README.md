This project is a boilerplate I made for myself because I couldnt find one. It uses the best CSS since frosted wheaties, TailwindCSS, and its partner in crime TailwindUI. Also it has purgeCSS to remove all that nasty unused CSS and runs in Vue, my favorite frontend tooling tool right now. ðŸ’ª

## Built with
